# Breast Cancer Detection

In this activity, you'll apply logistic regression to predict whether a specified breast tumor is benign or malignant by using computed features from digitized images. You'll then create the associated confusion matrix.

## Instructions

1. Split your data into training and testing data.

2. Create a logistic regression model with Sklearn.

3. Fit the model to the training data.

4. Compute the accuracy score for the training and the testing data separately.

5. Create a confusion matrix based on the testing dataset and the predicted values.

    **Hint:** You might receive a warning that the solver fails to converge. For now, you can ignore that warning.
